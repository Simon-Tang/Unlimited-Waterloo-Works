            <strong>Unlimited Waterloo Works</strong> is a 3rd party Chrome extension that unlimits your WaterlooWorks experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            You use this extension at your own risk.
            It is possible that enabling this extension will have a negative impact on the functionality of WaterlooWorks, and the author makes no guarantee that this extension will continue to function properly as WaterlooWorks changes over time.
            This extension has no affiliation with WaterlooWorks, its developers, or the University of Waterloo.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scope of this extension is to only make cosmetic changes, and not interfere with the underlying functionality.  However, since this extension is in beta, consider disabling the extension when you want to be absolutely sure that nothing can go wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            With that said, the author hopes that you enjoy this extension and get lots of offers!  Please leave some suggestions in the Chrome Web Store!

            I am the Bone of my Co-op<br />
            Disruption is my Body and Innovation is my Blood.<br />
            I have created over a Thousand Side Projects,<br />
            Unknown to Cali,<br />
            But well-known to Bust.<br />
            Have procrastinated on Assignments to create many Job Applications<br />
            Yet those will never lead to Offers.<br />
            So, as I Pray--<br />
